# Binary-Search-Tree-Library-in-c-plus-plus
Binary Search tree library or Binary search tree header file project give various function 
that help in programming of BST(Binary search tree)
Features:
1. Project can store any data type (int,float,double,char) in nodes.
2. Like vector class at the time of creation any object, By passing array, it create a tree 
    BST<int>(n,arr); // N is number of nodes in array
3. To take head of BST use obj.BSTHead
4. Create a new copy of existing tree ( like create a new tree in some other address in heap only the values of node and structure are saem)
5. Delete a node
6. insert a node
7. search a node
8. Find inorder,postorder,preorder, levelOrder traversal of BST and return a vector
9. FInd Predessor and Successor of a node
10. Find kthLargest and kthSmallest element in BST

Note: Project file is saved as c++ file (main function does not exists in this). So anybody can use it as a header file
